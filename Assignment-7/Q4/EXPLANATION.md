# what was wrong in the code
-- The filter function was getting executed before the fetching so it was filtering an empty data and returned empty
The throttle function didnâ€™t support passing parametersand also "this" which could cause issues if the function ever needs arguments or uses this. 

#  How you fixed it
-- for filter bug I added an if condition where it checks that data is empty and if empty it returns 

if(data.length===0) return

-- for throttle I added func.apply(this, args);
